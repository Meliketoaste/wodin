Thinking of eventually using this wm, for most my needs. Though we will see. I attempted to solve the problem as directly and minimally as I could. Not sure if dynamic arrays is the best way to describe tiling layouts.

Also keeping some work in progress versions since I would of found that usefull, when building my own one. Considering making an XCB version and then just eventually make an version using only the sockets without the client libraries.
